<h1>Erik's Best Video Games</h1>
<h2>My favorite video games ever</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Mass Effect</h3>
<p>One of the best stories I've experienced in a game series. Love the characters and universe that they created.</p>
<h3>Skyrim</h3>
<p>Endless possibilities of what to do, especially with mods. One of the best open world games.</p>
<h3>Tears of the Kingdom</h3>
<p>Might be my favorite game of all time, but I still have to finish it. However, this game has so much to do, and I want to do all of it at the same time. Exploration, puzzles, combat, building cool contraptions, it's all amazingly fun.</p>
